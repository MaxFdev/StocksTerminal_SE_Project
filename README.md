Needs:

>Who would use it?

Anyone from brokers trying to get a quick breakdown of a certain stock to everyday people trying to educate themselves on current public finances to software engineers trying to simplify stock data.

> What functions are provided?

 A "get" for general information, as well as a storage for previously accessed stocks that it auto-refreshes. It will also allow for summarizing tools in order to isolate prioritized information.

> Why?

To simplify and organize the information-getting process for stock data.
  
> How?

1. Run the program .jar file.

2. make a call to the program using "stock" as the first item of your args.

3. use one of the following commands to call and retrieve data:

        (a) "help" - prints a list of available commands and options, as well as a short description of each, akin to this list.

        (b) "[Stock_Symbol(s)] -- [command(s)]" - executes the given command(s) on the stock symbol provided - separate symbols and commands with commas. Examples provided:
            - AAPL, AMZN -- price, , 


The ideal experience using this product is straightforward: use the "help" or read the code in order to understand the commands, then apply them as you wish.
