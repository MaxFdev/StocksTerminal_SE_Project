StockTerminal is a Java-based program designed to retrieve and organize real-time stock market data efficiently. Developed with fintech professionals in mind, this project provides individuals with quick access to market data directly from the terminal. Leveraging a combination of object-oriented programming principles and various data structures, StockTerminal seamlessly fetches stock data from an API and presents it in a user-friendly format within the terminal. My partner and I effectively collaborated to develop StockTerminal as a functional program within two weeks.
